## Problem Statement

The management team requires comprehensive insights into Amazon product sales across various categories and regions in India. We have two CSV files containing sales data, and the goal is to utilize Power BI to analyze and visualize this information effectively. Key insights to be derived include:
-	The number of units sold within each product category
-	Total sales revenue generated per category
-	The count of sellers associated with each category
-	Monthly sales trends, highlighting the peak sales month
-	The current status and performance of each product category
-	The number of customer reviews for each category
These insights will enable the management to gain a clear understanding of the top-selling products, their distribution across states and cities, and the overall sales trends over time. This information will be crucial for strategic decision-making and optimizing product offerings in various regions.



### Steps followed 
- Step 1: Data Loading: Imported two CSV files containing Amazon product sales data into Power BI.

- Step 2: Data Cleaning and Transformation: Used Power Query to clean and format the data, focusing on refining the category column by inserting spaces between words that were previously joined.

- Step 3: Slicer Customization: Developed an advanced slicer incorporating both product names and images, enhancing the filtering options for a more interactive experience.

Report Page Design:

- Overview Page: Displays key metrics such as product status, total sales, sales by state and city, and seller count using card visuals. A column chart visualizes sales distribution across different states and cities.
- Product Page: Includes detailed product insights such as images, units sold, customer reviews, and sales trends by month, presented through tooltips for a more dynamic user experience.
- Product View Page: Offers an in-depth view of product performance with a custom date filter and a line chart that enables users to track sales trends over time.
